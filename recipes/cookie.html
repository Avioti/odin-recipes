    <p align="center"><b>A <em>Chocolate</em> lovers Dream!</b> </p>
        <p align="center"> With plenty of cocoa powder and big wells of dark chocolate, these double chocolate cookies are so fudgy that a tall glass of   
            cold milk is not only delicious, but essential — especially when they are 
            served hot from the oven. Just like David Leite’s impeccable chocolate 
            chip cookies, they bake up even better after the dough has had time to 
            rest in the fridge. The extralong chill gives the dough a chance to 
            hydrate fully and firm up, which yields more uniformly baked cookies, 
            with the perfect amount of crunch around the edges and chew in the center. 
            Thin chocolate discs or wafers, which are widely available, are used here. 
            They melt into lovely chocolate layers as the cookies bake. But if you 
            can’t find them, chocolate chips make a fine substitute; there's no need 
            to adjust the baking time. </p>
    
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>⅔ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 (1 ounce) squares white chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>¾ cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in cocoa and baking powder. Beat for 2 minutes. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Stir in flour by hand. Mix in white chocolate and chocolate chips. Cover dough, and chill for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Divide dough into two parts, and roll each part into a 9 inch long log. Place logs on lightly greased cookie sheet, about 4 inches apart. Flatten slightly.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool on cookie sheet for 5 minutes, then carefully transfer to a wire rack to cool for one hour. </li>
        <li>Cut each loaf into 1/2 inch wide diagonal slices. Place slices on an ungreased cookie sheet, and bake at 325 degrees F ( 165 degrees C) for 9 minutes. Turn cookies over, and bake for 7 to 9 minutes. Cool completely, then store in an airtight container.</li>

<p align="center"><b>Fancy</em> Hot Chocolate<em> ooooo!</em></b>
    <br><br> Low caffeine, low sugar hot chocolate with raw cacao and adaptogens including reishi mushroom, maca, ashwagandha, and he shou wu. The perfect cozy beverage to replace coffee or matcha in the morning, or to wind down with in the evening.
</p>

<h2>Ingrediants</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 ounces very hot water (or sub favorite dairy-free milk)
        <li>    1 Tbsp unsweetened cacao powder (or cocoa powder)</li>
        <li>    1/2 tsp Ashwagandha </li>
         <li>   1 tsp Reishi mushroom powder</li>
         <li>1 tsp Maca</li>
            <li>1 tsp coconut butter (or sub store-bought)</li>
                <li> 1 Tbsp Tocos (a.k.a. rice bran solubles* // if using dairy-free milk, omit)</li>
                    <li>Sweetener of choice (we love stevia, maple syrup, raw honey to taste)</li>
                        <li>1/4 tsp He shou wu (optional)</li>
                            <li>1/8 tsp cinnamon (optional)</li>
                                <li> 1 scoop collagen* (optional // see notes for vegan option)</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To a high-speed blender (or small blender), add hot water (or dairy-free milk), cacao powder, ashwagandha, reishi, maca, coconut butter, tocos, and sweetener of choice (we prefer stevia to taste). Add he shou wu, cinnamon, and collagen at this time as well (all optional). Note: If using dairy-free milk in place of water, you can opt to skip the tocos and coconut butter as they're largely there to provide creaminess.</li>
        <li>Blend on high until creamy and frothy — about 1 minute. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more sweetener to taste, cacao for rich chocolate flavor, maca for malty flavor, or coconut butter for coconut flavor / butteriness. The adaptogens / mushrooms can be a bit on the bitter side; adding more coconut butter, cacao, and sweetener will offset this.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy immediately. You can also make this in a big batch for the week and reheat throughout the week as needed either on the stovetop in a saucepan, or in our go-to milk frother. Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days (though best when fresh). Not freezer friendly.</li>
