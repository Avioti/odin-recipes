    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10 ounces very hot water (or sub favorite dairy-free milk)
            <li>    1 Tbsp unsweetened cacao powder (or cocoa powder)</li>
            <li>    1/2 tsp Ashwagandha </li>
             <li>   1 tsp Reishi mushroom powder</li>
             <li>1 tsp Maca</li>
                <li>1 tsp coconut butter (or sub store-bought)</li>
                    <li> 1 Tbsp Tocos (a.k.a. rice bran solubles* // if using dairy-free milk, omit)</li>
                        <li>Sweetener of choice (we love stevia, maple syrup, raw honey to taste)</li>
                            <li>1/4 tsp He shou wu (optional)</li>
                                <li>1/8 tsp cinnamon (optional)</li>
                                    <li> 1 scoop collagen* (optional // see notes for vegan option)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To a high-speed blender (or small blender), add hot water (or dairy-free milk), cacao powder, ashwagandha, reishi, maca, coconut butter, tocos, and sweetener of choice (we prefer stevia to taste). Add he shou wu, cinnamon, and collagen at this time as well (all optional). Note: If using dairy-free milk in place of water, you can opt to skip the tocos and coconut butter as they're largely there to provide creaminess.</li>
            <li>Blend on high until creamy and frothy â€” about 1 minute. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more sweetener to taste, cacao for rich chocolate flavor, maca for malty flavor, or coconut butter for coconut flavor / butteriness. The adaptogens / mushrooms can be a bit on the bitter side; adding more coconut butter, cacao, and sweetener will offset this.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy immediately. You can also make this in a big batch for the week and reheat throughout the week as needed either on the stovetop in a saucepan, or in our go-to milk frother. Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days (though best when fresh). Not freezer friendly.</li>
        </ol>
